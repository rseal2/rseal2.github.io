        <h2 class="overview"><b>FarmFresh</b> In this capstone project, I designed an application that is centered around the experience of going to the Farmer‚Äôs Market. The purpose of the application is to make it easier for consumers to find out more about the vendors and the food that they purchase at the Farmer‚Äôs Market. üë©üèª‚Äçüåæ
            <br><br>
            In short, I want to streamline the process of learning more about the food that an individual consumes. 
            The focus for this app was placed on a minimal number of actions that would be executed seamlessly in a visually satisfying and appealing way.</h2>

        <h2 class = "overview">In order to make the most informed decisions and choices throughout this capstone, I made use of the <b>Design Thinking Process.</b> </h2>
        <div class="over"><img src = "Farm Fresh Images/1_33khN9zpFCMWnF8pLqeVTQ 1.png"></div>
        <h2><b><em>Intial Ideation</em></b></h2>
        <h2 class = "overview">This project is an attempt to make it <b>easier</b> for individuals who go to the farmers market to get information on the vendors such as the <b>history</b>, <b>growing patterns</b>, <b>location</b>, etc. 

            <br><br>Currently, the Union Square Farmers Market has a website that includes a list of all of the vendors as well as the location and dates/times, but the information is capped at just that. 
            
            <br><br>With this project, I would like to create an application that can allow users to scroll through the different vendors and be able to easily receive information regarding their services as well as products. 
            </h2>

        <h2><b><em>Secondary Research</em></b></h2>
        <h2 class = "overview">In terms of research, I first sent out a Google Survey to a wide array of people ot get a better understanding of my target demographic. </h2>
        <div class = "over"><img src = "Farm Fresh Images/Frame 6.png"></div>
        <h2 class = "over">I then chose 5 individuals from my Google survey to interview and ask more extensive questions. Here are a few of the questions that I asked to help lead the conversation: 

            <ol>How interested are you in what makes up the products/goods that you buy?</ol>
            <ol>How often do you go to a farmers market? </ol>
            <ol>What types of products/goods do you buy at the farmers market? </ol>
            <ol>How often do you talk to the vendors at the farmers market? </ol>
            <ol>Where do you get the information regarding the farmers market from? </ol>
            <ol>Do you prefer to get your groceries at the farmers market or local supermarket?</ol>
            <ol>If you prefer to get your groceries at the farmers market, why is that the case?</ol>
            
            After conducting user interviews, I narrowed it down to <b>4</b> main research insights</h2>
        
        <div class = "over"><img src = "Farm Fresh Images/Frame 7.png"></div>
        
        <h2><b><em>Primary Research</em></b></h2>
        <h2 class = "overview">I then did a heuristic analysis of applications centered around the Farmer‚Äôs Market experience.</h2>
        <h2 class = "overview">Whole Foods:
            Whole Foods is a large scale supermarket. The application allows the user to browse sales from their local store and streamline the in person shopping experience. It also allows the user to order food straight to their destination, discover new products, as well as create a customized shopping list based on their preferences and recurring favorites.

            Flexibility & Efficiency of Use: Good <br>
            Aesthetic & Minimalist Design: Good<br>
            Consistency & Standards: Good<br><br>
            
            Local Farmer‚Äôs Market:
            Local Farmers Market is a newer application that allows users to show the closest Farmers Markets within 25 miles of your location. Due to the newness of the app, it only works in certain areas. If the market has added the information, the user also should be able to see information such as the schedule, website, as well as product availability. 
            <br><br>
            Flexibility & Efficiency of Use: Poor<br>
            Aesthetic & Minimalist Design: Average<br>
            Consistency & Standards: Average<br>
            <br><br>
            Farmer‚Äôs Market U.S.:
            Farmer‚Äôs Market U.S. essentially searches and finds Farmer‚Äôs Markets near a user‚Äôs current location. It also lists the hours of operations and what products are offered. The application implements a connection directly to Apple Maps which shows the location of the selected market and then provides directions.
